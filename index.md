# Hello World

This is my home page! My name is Kaitong Guo and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is Mathematics.

## Computer Science Projects

### CPSC 120

* Lab 2
The part about compiling the code is my favorite because I really like to learn to use git clone to compile my code. My goal for this lab is to learn how to edit files and change the file back to GitHub so I can have a feeling of being a great programmer. It is a very important tool for all of my future labs so I could feel more confident during coding.

* Lab 5
Part 2 of Lab 5 is my favorite because I like the steps for me to convert from integer to double during coding. My goal for this lab is to learn how to play with different kinds of numbers on a computer very well because they are very useful for coding things in my life. As a lover of math, numbers are needed to be very accurate all the time.

* Lab 6
The debugging compile error part from this lab is my favorite because it can be super helpful for me to find the errors. It is very important for me to code everything correctly to make any types of functions work. One thing I learned from this is how even little mistakes can cause serious problems for my programming.
